# Sentbyte

Sentbyte tells you how much truth there is in the news for a given day, its literal interpretations allow for a rather ironic view of our reality. 
It works as an experiment in sentiment analysis, showing plots where the ratio between truthful and deceitful articles for certain brands can be seen. 
The article themselves are also displayed on the console as the user closes the windows containing the graphs that represent the information. 
It is an attempt of joining both the humanities and technology.
